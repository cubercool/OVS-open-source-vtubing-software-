# vtubing-pngtubing-for-raspberry-pi
I am working on making a full functional and easy to vtube and PNG tube on a raspberry pi. (curently only png tubing) this progect will be open source so feel free to pitch in :D but there are some do's and dont's                                                                             
1. you can use this for vtubing/pngtubing all you want
2. please dont take my/contributers code and make it your own software or sell it
3. you can contribute to the software all you want, just make sure at the top of the code add to the line where i have names eg #by koko,green bean, larry and james
4. THIS PROGECT WILL EVENTUALY BECOME CLOSE SOURCE (if you contributed you will still be credited if you put your username)
5. have fun using my/contributers code :D
