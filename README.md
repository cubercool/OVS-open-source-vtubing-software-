# vtubing-pngtubing-for-raspberry-pi
## OVS (open source vtubing software)
I/contributors are working on making a fully functional and easy-to-use VTube and PNG tube software on Raspberry Pi. (currently only PNG tubing) This project will be open source, so feel free to pitch in :D But there are some dos and don'ts                                                                             
1. You can use this for vtubing/PNGtubing all you want
2. Please don't take my/contributors  code and make it your software or sell it
3. You can contribute to the software all you want, just make sure at the top of the code, add to the line where I have names, eg #by koko, green bean, larry and james
4. Yes you can use AI but make sure it is not all AI :3
5. Have fun using our code :D

## How to contribute?:
1. Copy and paste your edited code into a file, and submit a pull through request and I will go over it. and make the changes on the main file (you will be credited)


# How to use the file:
### for raspberry pi:
You will need to create a virtual environment and download the required libraries (make sure you have pip3 installed)
1. pygame
2. numpy
3. sounddevice
Please install those libraries, or the program WILL break :P pip install pygame sounddevice numpy

### Where do the PNGs go?                                                
You will need to make a new folder that includes the OVS.py file in it, eg /home/koko/OVS_folder

Please name the PNG files as: 
1. talking PNG you have as talking.png
2. Idle PNG as idle.png
3. blinking PNG as blink.png
